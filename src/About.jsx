    <p>GiBook is derived from 'Give' and 'Book'. <br/>GiBook means giving book to someone whom you want to share the book.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>This page is created for the purpose of imaging true digital book sharing.<br/><br/></p>

    <p>These days, we are reading digital book by using kindle for example.<br/> However, the problem of digital book is that we cannot share the books we read even if we really want to share the book. <br></br>In the real world, we can borrow and rent the books.<br/> So we can share the content, and talk about that with each other.</p>
    <img className="bookSharing" src={bookSharing} alt="sharing_img"/>
    <p>GiBook can provide the feeling of sharing the book which you like. <br/>If you find the book intersting, you can soon share the content by sending access token.</p>
