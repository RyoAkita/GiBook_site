      <h3>VISION for LIFE</h3>
      <h4>1.Set up a VISION for LIFE</h4>
      <p className="content">Almost all company have their vision and work on their business everyday in order to achieve the VISION. The purpose of this book is regrasp the understanding of VISION well and apply the idea to individuals by setting a VISION for our lives.  This book is for the people who do not know things to do, or lost the direction of life.</p>
      <p className="content">I started to write this book because I felt upset by the situation that people who achieved something great stuff is around me on SNS such as Twitter and Instagram.
      Most people could be feeling these kind of problem. The “super”  people list incredible achievement on their profile which I do not have, and there always is a concern that I should have such kind of achievement to spend good life. However, on the study of marketing, I met a thought “VISION for LIFE” which can solve the problem argued above.</p>
      <p className="content">Through this book, I want you to discover a axis of your life and things to do for your better life. Like as a company goes on their way to make their VISION come true even they compete their sales number with other companies. I hope all individuals have their VISION to achieve through their life.</p>

      <h4>2. What is VISION?</h4>
      <p className="content">First of all, let’s catch the meaning of vision and what vision indicates. vision is significantly ambiguous business term which is used often. We use this term with abstract understanding. vision is separated vi- and -sion. vi- is derived from latin word, “videre”. This means “seeing” generally, visible contains vi- for example. Then, -sion means stuff, so vision has to be a visible stuff if we see this word from the view of definition. Therefore, when we think about VISION, the VISION must contain visual information at least. </p>
      <p className="content">As the explanation above illustrates, VISION is the sentence which shows the ideal world image with visual information. It is not like “Make better world!” because this is too abstract and contains no visual information. Amazon, for instance, posts “The everything store”. This sentence shows some visual information that there is a store selling various thing in it.</p>
      <p className="content">Some misunderstand that VISION is like “1 billion sales a year!!”. If we use number, the sentence become a goal which have totally different trait from VISION. Numerical goal cannot motivate people truly in the most of cases. VISION and numerical goal brings different result.</p>
      <p className="content">In addition to this, VISION must have a public view. In other words, VISION should not indicate the world “I” want to create, but should show the wrold “we” want to create. VISION can obtain a great power with getting sympathy from many people. That’s why VISION should be public desire.</p>
      <p className="content">I want to introduce an amazing VISION example, which is from Martin Luther King Jr.’s speech(1963). He said ” I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.” Even though this sentence illustrated unbelievable image at that time, the audience could get a vivid visual image into their mind. Once they received the visual image and were sympathized, the VISION played an important role for America’s history. That’s why Martin Luther King Jr.’s speech is handed down by now. </p>

      <h4>3. What’s the purpose of having VISION?</h4>
      <p className="content">Taking life as trip, having a VISION means having a compass. Like compass tells us which way to go, VISION tells us which action you should take, what to do in your life. Even if you are going to different direction from other people, you can be confident of that with having clear VISION.</p>
      <p className="content">These days, the development of technology is super fast, so the world changing speed is also fast. Take, for example,  iPhone and Facebook is spread in a moment, then changed the whole world view in a flash. If you chase the everything that appears to our society, you cannot catch up with those technology and lost the way you go. In this kind of situation, you need to have something which guides you like a compass. Putting it another way, you need to have a VISION for your life.</p>
      <p className="content">Company goes into bankruptcy if they focus on only monetary benefit. Company must have their VISION to achieve. This could be applied to individual level, people all must have VISION to achieve.</p>
      <p className="content">No doubt, having a ideal world VISION provides what to do now and from now like  compass in a trip.</p>

      <h4>4. Find your own VISION</h4>
      <p className="content">In many cases, VISION is based on the story. If people who do not know about the space started to post a VISION like “I want to change the space industry, to live in the space!!”, the audience may not be sympathized by the VISION. Firstly,  you have to know yourself deeply. “The magic of note-taking(メモの魔力)” is in fashion, its 1000 questions can make you find yourself deeply. Then, you try to find the area which you can be motivated, you want to change. The point you do not like, you can make it better in your life can be a key for creating your VISION.</p>
      <p className="content">The VISION  needs to be explained in a sentence and be visualized. At this moment, it is really important to ask “WHY” you choose the VISION, “WHY” you want to create the ideal world in the future. This “WHY” questions plays an filtration role.</p>

      <h4>5. VISION-Mission</h4>
      <p className="content">VISION and mission has a deep relationship. Contrast to the VISION is the ideal world for you to achieve in a long term, mission is things to do now in order to achieve the world. Company can exist because there are things to do, mission. We can understand what to do when we grasp the way to VISION.</p>
      <p className="content">Now, Amazon’s VISION is “to be Earth’s most customer-centric company, where customers can find and discover anything they might want to buy online.” Then, they set a mission to achieve the VISION, which is “We strive to offer our customers the lowest possible prices, the best available selection, and the utmost convenience.” Amazon takes actions with awaring their VISION and mission. Mission should be the way to achieve the VISION.</p>
      <p className="content">What is individual level’s mission for you? If you find your own VISION, you will be aware of the next step to take.</p>

      <h4>6.Set up your own VISION for your life</h4>
      <p className="content">To conclude, I want you to setup your own VISION. I found what to do in my life thanks to meet “VISION for LIFE” thinking. Have your compass, not to lose your direction to go. Have your VISON, not to lose your direction to go.</p>
